# Titanic Dataset Visualization: Bar Chart & Histogram

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to create **bar charts** and **histograms** to visualize the distribution of variables in the Titanic dataset. The Titanic dataset contains passenger information such as age, gender, class, and survival status.

## Objectives

* Explore the Titanic dataset to understand passenger demographics
* Visualize categorical variables (e.g., gender, passenger class) using bar charts
* Visualize continuous variables (e.g., age, fare) using histograms
* Gain insights into survival patterns and population characteristics

## Dataset

The dataset includes the following key columns:

* `Survived`: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
* `Pclass`: Passenger class (1, 2, 3)
* `Sex`: Gender (male, female)
* `Age`: Age in years
* `SibSp`: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
* `Parch`: Number of parents/children aboard
* `Fare`: Ticket fare

## Tools & Libraries

* Python
* Pandas (data handling)
* Matplotlib or Seaborn (visualization)

## Steps

1. Load the Titanic dataset
2. Select variables to analyze (categorical or continuous)
3. Choose the appropriate chart type:

   * Bar chart for categorical variables (e.g., `Sex`, `Pclass`, `Survived`)
   * Histogram for continuous variables (e.g., `Age`, `Fare`)
4. Plot the chart
5. Interpret the distribution and patterns

## Example Visualizations

* **Bar Chart**: Count of passengers by gender or survival status
* **Histogram**: Distribution of passenger ages or fares

## Use Cases

* Understanding passenger demographics
* Exploring survival patterns
* Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) for machine learning or statistical studies

## Conclusion

Bar charts and histograms are essential tools to visualize the Titanic dataset. They help uncover patterns in passenger demographics, class distribution, and survival, supporting deeper insights into historical data.

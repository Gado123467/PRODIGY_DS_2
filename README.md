# Titanic Dataset Visualization: 

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to create **bar charts** and **histograms** to visualize the distribution of variables in the Titanic dataset. The Titanic dataset contains passenger information such as age, gender, class, and survival status.

## Objectives

* Explore the Titanic dataset to understand passenger demographics
* Visualize categorical variables (e.g., gender, passenger class) using bar charts
* Visualize continuous variables (e.g., age, fare) using histograms
* Gain insights into survival patterns and population characteristics

## Dataset

The dataset includes the following key columns:

* `Survived`: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
* `Pclass`: Passenger class (1, 2, 3)
* `Sex`: Gender (male, female)
* `Age`: Age in years
* `SibSp`: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
* `Parch`: Number of parents/children aboard
* `Fare`: Ticket fare

## Tools & Libraries

Tableau



## Use Cases

* Understanding passenger demographics
* Exploring survival patterns
* Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) for machine learning or statistical studies

## Conclusion

---

*This project emphasizes clear and effective visual representation of Titanic passenger data.*
